SEARCH:


To search in node,role,enviornment,client,data_bags

to display all the nodes:

knife search node "*:*"

particular attribute in the node:

knife search node "*:*" -a ipaddress

node name starts with Web:

knife search node "name:web*"

knife search node "name:web*" -a ipaddress

search with multiple conditions:

knife search node "name:web AND recipes:apache"

same we can search in all  node,role,enviornment,client,data_bags indexes.



Include Search inside recipe file:

first use Search query and save it to varaible

all_web_nodes = search('node','name:web')

members = []  - array to store required values.

loop through the all_web_nodes variable for ipaddress,hostname etc...example:

all_web_nodes.each do |web_node|

	member = {
		
		'hostname' => web_node[hostname],
		'ipaddress' => web_node[ipaddress],
		'port' => 80,
		'ssl_port' => 80
	}
	
	members.push(member)
end


node.default['haproxy']['members'] = members
